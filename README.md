# Text-Classification-using-Glove-and-LSTM (NLP)
Natural Language Processing
## From data preparation to building model and deploy the model to web service.

Part 1 : Preparing data
 - read document
 - clean data
 - convert to phrases
 - labeling and generating training dataset
 
Part 2 : Building the model
 - load glove embedding vetor
 - create embedding matrix
 - tokenization of the text
 - create Neural Network model in Keras 
   (embedding matrix - convolutional layer - LSTM - softmax)

Part 3 : Model deployment in Azure (Microsoft Web Service)
 - Create Workspace
 - Pickle the model
 - Register the model
 - Create Image
 - Deploy WebService
 - Test calling web service
